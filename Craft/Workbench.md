## Workbench
~~I plan on following fairly closely the [Anarchists Workbench](https://books.anealkhimani.com)  by Christopher Schwarz, to build my bench.  I don't think I'll need the length he uses in his book, but perhaps I'll make it 8' long anyway.  My initial thought was that 6' would suffice, but now that I write this, I wonder if 2' shorter will really make any difference?

~~My first requirement will be to purchase lots of 2x12 lumber.  For this, I'd like to visit an actual lumber yard (and not just an orange Big Box store).  He says that No. 1 yellow pine should be ideal.  I don't know if that can even be had at Big Box.

~~It's slowly dawning on me that this project is going to be expensive.  I have no idea what the final cost will be but I'm estimating it around $500 -$800 for lumber alone.  When you factor in the tools I'll need (lots and lots of clamps), glue, clamp/vice hardware, drill bits etc.  It could be well north of 1k. :(


## *NEW* Workbench
Welp, it turns out that I decided on a different route than the Anarchist's Workbench mentioned above.  I saw a couple videos of some guys building workbenches completely out of plywood with a sort of lamination technique.  It inspired me enough to actually __buy__ plans (and __*print them out*__)!

They're attached here too.  It looks like it'll be cheaper and much easier than doing it with a laminated lumber top (and won't require 1000 clamps.).  Also, I don't know that I actually _need_ a full-on furniture making workbench, and it appears that this one will allow me to achieve what it is I'm working towards (making kumiko panels and maybe eventually selling them!)

Now my only obstacle is purchasing plywood/MDF and actually making this happen.  From a cursory glance it appears that I'll need 4 sheets to pull it off (plus lots more glue and some long lag screws to hold the top to the base).  I'm excited and Imma get started right away (2024-05-07)

After I'm done building it, I'll investigate adding a vice or 2 to it.
