# kserver (192.168.1.207)
#kserver is a computer on our #Elgin network.  It currently has Debian installed as the OS.
Its job is to serve applications and do chores to make life easier for Liz and myself (although, I doubt it makes things _easier_ for me...)


Currently, it's running most of it's automations/applications utilizing #docker as a containerization platform.
