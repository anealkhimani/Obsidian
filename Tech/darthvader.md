## Notes
---
This physical device used to serve as [[kserver]].  I swapped the physical chassis/motherboard/HD between the two machines in April 2024.

I was given an old Video Card by [[Alan Shiflett | Alan]] and I installed it ~ the same time as swapping machines.  The video card is an NVIDIA P1000.  It boasts 4 Mini DP outputs.  To date, I have one display panel that can accommodate a Display Port input and I've utilized it.  I've ordered a couple of adapters that should change Mini DP Male -> HDMI Female, so I can utilize the many HDMI cables I have laying about

I've also ordered some SATA power jumper cables so I can add a second HD.  In my old daily driver, I had an old 1.5TB FreeAgent drive installed (for various, things)

The new machine has a spare SATA data port on the motherboard, but doesn't have the appropriate power cable to accommodate it, thus the jumpers
