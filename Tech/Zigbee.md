### Door Sensors
The door sensors are affixed to:
- front door
- basement door
- kitchen door
- hall door (to basement stairs)
These sensors hold CR1632 batteries.  They seem to report 100% battery life at all time, despite their _true_ battery remaining.
I replaced the battery in the sensor attached to the hall door [[2024-04-26]].  Doing so seemed to help the state reporting back to [[Home Assistant]] and the automations around it are working now.
