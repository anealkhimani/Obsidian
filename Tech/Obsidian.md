### [[darthvader]] install

On my home machine, I had to download the AppImage version of this application.  This is basically a way that devs can package the entire application and all dependencies into one file so there's no distribution headaches.  Also, it doesn't need to be installed so no root privileges are required.

The downside to this is that it doesn't integrate into the GUI for Ubuntu as other, installed applications might (no automatic start menu, no panel addition, no config folder etc.)

I was able to overcome this by using instructions [here](https://askubuntu.com/questions/774490/what-is-an-appimage-how-do-i-install-it)
