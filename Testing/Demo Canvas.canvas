I created it by clicking the 'node' on the right edge of the Dataview Testing note connected and selecting 'New Card'.  \nYou can also probably just drag a new card from the small icon below.  The third way is right-click the canvas and select 'new card'.  Duh\n\nCards aren't actual *notes* Ias in, they aren't .md files). They live here on a Canvas only.\n\nNow, let's say you write a bunch of shit here, and you want to *turn* it into a note, you can right-click this card, and select  `Convert to File` and viola, Bob's your Uncle.\n\nYou can see the difference between this card and it's linked note because this card has no label, but the linked note does :)\n","x":-420,"y":-1400,"width":468,"height":520}
