## Some considerations
This community plugin comes with some built-in goodness.  There's a Modal that you can use to create tasks in a special way, with lots of options.  You can either toggle it with the Command Palette `Tasks: Create or Edit` or with the hotkey combo I created for this purpose `Ctrl + Shift + t`
Why not try it in the section below?

### Below is a list of tasks.  We're going to try to use the tasks plugin to do fun stuff

- [ ] Get busy with the stuff
- [ ] Walk the dog  [due:: 2024-03-05]
- [ ] Try the veal, and the hotkey shortcut



### Here is a tasks query that retrieves all tasks tracked by the plugin. 
As you can see, the two we created up above show up in the list below.

```tasks
not done
```
