## Some considerations
This community plugin comes with some built-in goodness.  There's a Modal that you can use to create tasks in a special way, with lots of options.  You can either toggle it with the Command Palette `Tasks: Create or Edit` or with the hotkey combo I created for this purpose `Ctrl + Shift + t`
Why not try it in the section below?
I opted _not_ to use a global identifier with the tasks.  I'm told in the documentation that this will make the Tasks Plugin track all items in all files that utilize the default checkbox workflow as tasks.  If I _had_ used one, you'd need to create tasks to be tracked by this plugin by utilizing that special global identifier.

### Below is a list of tasks.  We're going to try to use the tasks plugin to do fun stuff

- [ ] Get busy with the stuff
- [ ] Walk the dog  [due:: 2024-03-05]
- [ ] Try the veal, and the hotkey shortcut
- [ ] Use the Dataview Format  [due:: 2024-03-11] [priority:: high ]
- [ ] On restart and after a setting change, now there's create dates automatically added.  But I'm not seeing it happen
- [ ] Looks like you have to use the modal to add an automatic Created Date  [created:: 2024-03-04]






### Here is a tasks query that retrieves all tasks tracked by the plugin. 
As you can see, the ones we created up above show up in the list below.
