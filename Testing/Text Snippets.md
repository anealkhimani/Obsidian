This is a [plugin](https://github.com/ArianaKhit/text-snippets-obsidian) I added on [[2024-04-11]]

It allows you to define a text expansion snippet that is replaced when you invoke the replacement function (either by hotkey, or by calling from the Ctrl-P command pallet the `Text Snippets: Run snippet replacement` command)

Out of the box, it has a snippet called 'snippets' _(I replaced the keyword with 'snip')_
you can see the functionality if you type the word `snip` and literally hit the hotkey (or call the command mentioned above)

Here's why I added it:
I wanted to make updating template pages easier for mundane things like adding email addresses.  Since this plugin allows you to move your cursor to specific locations and set tab stops for the inserted text, I thought it would work well for when I create an actual hyperlinked email address in a note _(mailto://)_.

I'm also going to experiment with just typing the address and highlighting it, then in a right-click context menu selecting 'External Link' to see if this makes it better

GAH!  Turns out Obsidian automagically converts typed email addresses to hyperlinks.  Good to know!
