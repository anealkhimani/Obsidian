## General Notes
---
### What is special about today?
- Added a [[DigitalOcean]] droplet to host websites/applications for [[Total Tent Rental]]
	- Installed Docker per instructions [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/debian/)
	- Updated default docker logging driver to 'local', rather than using the default logging mechanism.  This theoretically should keep file sizes down and automatically handle rotation/optimization etc?  Followed directions [here](https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/logging/local/)
	- 
- Called [[Mark Petro]] to get some advice on how to start this whole thing.
