## General Notes
---
### What is special about today?
- Added a [[DigitalOcean]] droplet (Debian) to host websites/applications for [[Total Tent Rental]]
	- Created an 'anealkhimani' user on that box, added SSH public keys from my work lappy and my [[darthvader]] machine at home
	- Installed Docker per instructions [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/debian/)
	- Updated default  [[Docker]] logging driver to 'local', rather than using the default logging mechanism.  This theoretically should keep file sizes down and automatically handle rotation/optimization etc?  Followed directions [here](https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/logging/local/)
	- Implemented my [[Github]] repo 'dotfiles' here.  This included initializing a bare git repository in my $HOME folder, pulling the repo down and using the dotfiles in the repo to configure VIM and oh-my-zsh.  Overall it went smoothly


- Called [[Mark Petro]] to get some advice on how to start this whole thing.
