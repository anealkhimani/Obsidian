# General Notes
---
### What is special about today?
- Going to head out a little early today to intercept the foundation repair/inspection person Liz setup to come by the house.  Need to try to get home by around 3pm
- Conducting Email Safety presentation to half the LTI staff, second half will be tomorrow and any stragglers will be next week in a make-up session that I schedule.
- Modified my [[ADP]] direct deposit to divert an additional $85/pay period to our [[Chase]] joint checking account (to cover the change in our mortgage/property taxes)
### Learning/Working On:
- did some cursory investigation on bird houses.  



# TODO
---
- [ ] Need to design a second model of birdhouse, and maybe a bird feeder too so I can create one or two of them.
- [ ] Investigate which birds are most common in GA, and create/download some plans for houses to accommodate them
