## General Notes

### What is special about today?

### Business License
Boy howdy
So I called [[DeKalb County]], specifically the Dept. of Planning & Sustainability, and spoke to a nice lady that helped me understand what forms were needed to apply for a business license.  I'm going to fill those out digitally, print, sign notarize, scan and upload them through the [DeKalb epermit website](https://epermits.dekalbcountyga.gov/home)

Once done, I'll attach them here (in the [[Total Tent Rental]] note) and in Google Drive under my business account, so I have access errwhere. 


### Business Insurance
Finally got a response from an insurance company [[Griffin & Company Insurance]].  They asked if I needed bounce-house insurance or not.  Not, for now...
