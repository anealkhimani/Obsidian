## General Notes

### What is special about today?
- Filled out some documentation for Dekalb County.
	- In order to do business under a Trade Name (Not my personal, name...) I have to register that Trade Name with The Clerk of Superior Court of Dekalb
	- The way to check if your desired trade name is taken already is to physically go to the courthouse and look through the books.
	- Once you've got a free name, you can file it with an [eFileGA](https://efilega.tylertech.cloud/OfsEfsp/ui/landing) account?
	- This last step was a pain in the ass, but I registered [here](https://efilega.tylertech.cloud/OfsEfsp/ui/register/user-information)
	- Created a Draft filing.  I'll need to complete it once I've checked the books as in the second point above
