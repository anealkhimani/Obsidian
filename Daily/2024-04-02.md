### What is special about today
~~Gonna attempt to connect to new [[kserver]] remotely today and see about starting to get it up and running.~~ (Done)

I'm teetering on whether or not to purchase some SATA drives to install in [[kserver]].  I saw a [good deal](https://www.amazon.com/Seagate-IronWolf-12TB-Internal-Drive/dp/B084ZTSMWF/ref=sr_1_3?crid=2L37WBIG1XTQS&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.YfXgQIwTbQX4QDBLStabxN3NB2at1MzWaiZ9EcVMCUIspD7LbQ0lgS8mxmx0LNlwlikxDW0dvt-Oo35zdAulo_Woswlb4r86rbCqCzmaWe_DOasZuIypRkrReYv0OKylmsJqlV49r0gJuExP7Kq454H8lVnd_GwZ-5CVyD3zUWSKcPldN33ORCRd0Re1MXBWRV1JWRE9bAq2D6mc5SHMEFcRTpnuuMXHFa8YIAqa_XA.L0Ilnt4IdDVZVP71VPmrAOVVW6-pRXtfs-tdKLA4FZc&dib_tag=se&keywords=ironwolf&qid=1712064065&sprefix=ironwolf%2Caps%2C94&sr=8-3&th=1) on some IronWolf Seagate 12TB NAS drives (7200 RPM) on Amazon.  They're $200 each.  I might pull the trigger.
