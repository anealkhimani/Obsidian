## General Notes
---
### What is special about today?


### Learning/Working On:
- Installed the `eza` tool on my work machine.  It's a modern replacement? for `ls`. It's interesting so far.  I aliased it with `e` and added several flags. We'll see if I can overcome muscle-memory and _actually use_ it at all.
- Installed node on [[kserver]] _(actually, nvm, from which I installed node)_
- Followed directions [here](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/debian-install-nodejs)
