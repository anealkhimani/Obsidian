## General Notes
---
### What is special about today?
Should receive a shipment of tables/chairs today at LTI.  I brought my trailer just in case I need it, but I don't think I will

### Learning/Working On:
Reading the Astro.build documentation.  Want to learn more about it since, you know, the website is _built_ with it?!


## Daily TODO
---

- [x] see if you can add 'import alias' paths to the ttr website tsconfig file and use aliased imports throughout.  Learning experiment at best  [priority:: low]  [created:: 2024-06-20]  [completion:: 2024-06-20]
- [ ] Examine the api_ttr endpoints and limit them to only pulling 'active' products from the db.  Eliminate the testing for 'active' products on the client side  [created:: 2024-06-20]
- [ ] Refactor the DB_URL_BASE Environment variables to more clearly reflect what they are (API_URL_BASE)  [created:: 2024-06-20]
- [ ] Create a custom 404 page to let users easily get back to the app  [created:: 2024-06-20]
- [ ] Consider using a json import to pull in data for the breadcrumb component  [created:: 2024-06-20]
