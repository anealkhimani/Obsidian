### What is special about today?
The saga continues!
Today I swapped hard drives/machines around in the basement to make the kserver motherboard/case into my daily driver and vice versa.  This dropped my daily driver down to 2 monitors tho, so I did that too.  Somehow I was able to get my old daily driver HD to boot up in the 'new' chassis so that's nice.
I couldn't get old [[kserver]] to boot in the new chassis however so I nuked the SSD and installed Debian 12.  This of course means I'll have to completely redo the damn Home Assistant container again...
