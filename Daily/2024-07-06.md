## General Notes

### What is special about today?


### Learning/Working On:
Somehow I discovered a pretty big thing that I didn't know about Docker networks (that I most certainly should have known).
If you need to put a service in more than one network, you have to set a traefik label to let traefik know which network it needs to forward traffic to. 

For example, if you have a network called `web` and you want to put your nginx service on that network as well as on the traefik network (`proxy` perhaps), you should add a label to the nginx service as such:
`- traefik.docker.network=proxy`

This way, you can pass traffic from the web to your nginx service, but also put a database on the same `web` network.  The services in the `web` network can talk to each other (like on a real network) but the database service cannot talk to the outside world because it's isolated from `proxy`

This is a BIG stumbling block that I think I might have just overcome.
