## General Notes
---
### What is special about today?
- Going to try to install an additional media player on [[kserver]] in order to try out new, possibly better solutions to Plex
- My initial ideas are [Emby](https://hub.docker.com/r/linuxserver/emby) and Kodi, although I'm not sure about either.  I need _more research!_

### Learning/Working On:
- I added a couple things to [[Obsidian]].  
	1. In the Obsidian `Files and Links` settings, I set all new notes to be created in the `Unsorted` folder.
	2. In the [[Templater]] settings, I told it to use a newly created [[UnsortedTemplate]] for all files that get created in that `Unsorted` folder.
	3. This UnsortedTemplate has a Templater script in it that forces the user to select a new note _type_ that automatically creates a new note using a specified template, and automatically moves it to a specified folder.  For example, if I create a new note, a pop-up asks if I want to create a `person`, or `computer` or `daily` note.  If I choose `person`, it automatically creates a new file using the [[PeopleTemplate]], and automatically moves it into the `People` folder.  Slick
	4. If the user cancels, or doesn't select any template, it just makes a blank note, and leaves it in the `Unsorted` folder.
