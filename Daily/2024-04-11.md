## General Notes
---
### What is special about today?
- Still working on [[NodeRed]].
- Installed SQLite3 on [[kserver]] so I could view the databases I create in NodeRed on the host (since NodeRed is running in a container with a host bound volume)
- I have APA League play tonight against a team that has 2 players with Skill Level 8.  I have _no doubt_ that our captain will post me against one of them :( .  Sigh.

### Learning/Working On:

## Wrap-Up Notes

### Did I accomplish anything?
### Future things to consider?
#### Final Thoughts
Looks like my APA team is disbanding.  I dunno if I'll continue playing on a different team or just stop.  I'm about 80% leaning towards the latter.
