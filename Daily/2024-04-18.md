## General Notes
---
### What is special about today?
- Swung by Harbor Freight to purchase a 'Kill-a-watt' device, used to measure the amperage draw of a device it's attached to.  I'll test the newly installed exhaust fan in the shop so I can see if I'm able to use a Zigbee plug switch to automate it.

### Learning/Working On:
- Today I'll wire an electrical outlet into the gable area above the entrances to the shop. This will allow me to switch the new exhaust fan on/off
