# General Notes
---
### What is special about today?
- Lots of issues with users and computers today at LTI
	- Several had docking station issues (power cycle seemed to help)
### What did I learn?
- I began learning how to use #Templates
- This very note was inserted via a [[DailyTemplate]]

### What's on my mind?




# TODO
---
- [ ] Need to swing by WalMart and look for some chocolate/gift type thing to buy for Liz (tomorrow is Valentines day)
- [ ] Begin designing (via [[Sketchup]]) an air-filter for the shop



## Wrap-Up Notes
---
### Did I accomplish anything?
- Installed the Templater Community Plugin.  It seems to be up my alley in that it will add a sort of 'templating language' to the app.  It will allow Javascript to be run in notes etc.  Gotta learn how to use it.
### Future things to consider?
