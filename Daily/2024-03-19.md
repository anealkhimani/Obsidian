## General Notes
---
### What is special about today?
- Added SSD drive to kserver (removing the old spinning disk). This new SSD now holds the OS Debian. 
- Removed the Spinning Disk before I could grab any data off of it.  I'll need to fix that by using either the USB SATA disk dock I own somewhere (packed away) or pull the one from work home with me.
- There's a LOT to do...


### Learning/Working On:



## Daily TODO
