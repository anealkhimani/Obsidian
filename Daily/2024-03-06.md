## General Notes

### What is special about today?
-  Had a meeting with Eric around change control for CSI items.
- Mostly this meeting was prompted by requests for changes to CSI from the general employees.  How do we make these changes?  Are there rules?  What's the process?
- Consider adding a workflow similar to the purchase requests.  All requests for custom fields and custom code should funnel through an individual who will vet the list.  Then, those requests pass through to us.
