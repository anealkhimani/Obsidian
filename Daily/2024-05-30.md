## General Notes
---
### What is special about today?
- On [[NameCheap]], I set the domains I purchased [[2024-05-29]] to use [[DigitalOcean]] as the DNS server.  That way I can manage the DNS there to point the domains to my Droplets, and eventually my running applications.

### Learning/Working On:
- Going to experiment today on setting up Traefik to run in a Docker container on my [[Total Tent Rental]] droplet.
