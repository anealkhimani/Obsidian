## General Notes
---
### What is special about today?
- Going to install #Cockpit (a web-based Linux server admin. tool) on [[kserver]] and try it out
See instructions [Here](https://cockpit-project.org/running.html#debian)

- Aquaguard is sending someone to give us a free estimate for repairing the water intrusion in our basement

### Learning/Working On:
- [Hardening Debian](https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/securing-debian-manual/index.en.html)
After installing the #Cockpit app above, I glanced at the logs and saw _MANY_ attempts by unscrupulous individuals attempting to access my machines.  I need to stop that and that's why I'm learning how to harden my Debian system on [[kserver]]



## Daily TODO
---
- [ ] Enable a BIOS password on [[kserver]] and disable booting from removable media  [priority:: medium]  [created:: 2024-03-29]  [due:: 2024-04-01]
