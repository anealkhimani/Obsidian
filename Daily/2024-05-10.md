## General Notes
---
### What is special about today?
I created a recurring purchase of $20 worth of BTC at [[Finance#^c6695a|Coinbase]]
This will automatically transfer $20 USD from my [[Finance#^4d337a|Chase]] Personal Checking account each Friday and convert that to BTC (held in my Coinbase online wallet.)

I'll probably schedule a transfer out of Coinbase on a recurring schedule
