## General Notes

### What is special about today?
I created a recurring purchase of $20 worth of BTC at [[Finance#^c6695a|Coinbase]]
This will automatically transfer $20 USD from my [[Finance#^4d337a|Chase]] Personal Checking account each Friday and convert that to BTC (held in my Coinbase online wallet.)

I'll probably transfer this asset out of Coinbase monthly? into my [[Finance#^43d370|Exodus]]
wallet.  There's a fee involved with both transactions :(
