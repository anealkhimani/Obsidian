# General Notes

### What is special about today?
- Didn't have to report to Jury Duty today in Dekalb Co.
- Learned that Rocket Mortgage has adjusted our Escrow account to match what Dekalb County is charging us for property tax.  This adjustment is going to increase our monthly mortgage by a whopping $650/month (that's 30%)  **NOT GOOD**


### Learning/Working On:
- Dataview plugin in [[Obsidian]]
