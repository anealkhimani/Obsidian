## General Notes
---
### What is special about today?
- Checking in on my Let's Encrypt certificates (used to create SSL connections to my websites).  I received an email several days ago letting me know that the certs for a couple of my domains were going to expire.  I'm looking into it.
- It appears when I read the logs of [[Traefik]] out on [[Digital Ocean]] I see _many_ entries about bad certs and communication issues.  I need to fix this today to prevent downtime (not that anyone visits my sites, but I do, and I don't wanna have to juggle stupid things to see the sites).
- So it looks like the certs that Let's Encrypt is complaining about are for plex.anealkhimani.com and home.anealkhimani.com.  I believe both of these were generated from my old [[kserver]] box.  I'm going to leave this alone for now, and when I decide to get these [[Domains]] back up, I'll address this then

### Learning/Working On:
- Installed [Immich](https://immich.app/) container to test it (on [[kserver]]).  It's an image view/share/storage tool.



## Daily TODO

- [x] Investigate [Guacamole](https://guacamole.apache.org/) server for [[kserver]]  [created:: 2024-04-16]  [completion:: 2024-05-09]
