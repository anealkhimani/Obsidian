### What is special about today?
- ~~Service Tech is coming to the house today between 4 and 5 pm to look at (sigh) foundation issues and possibly present a quote for repair costs~~
- Turns out the foundation folks can't make it today, and have rescheduled for next week. (Thursday, 2/22/24)
- I'm going to leave work early (3:30 ish) to intercept him/her so Liz doesn't have to face it alone

### What's on my mind?



# TODO

- [x] Remember to take the chocolates home for Liz (In fact, I'll put them in my bag now.)
