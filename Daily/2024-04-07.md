## General Notes
---
### What is special about today?
- Rode out to Microcenter in Duluth (near Steve Reynolds Blvd.) to pick up some drive bay adapters so I could  mount new HDs in [[kserver]]


### Learning/Working On:
- Added repositories to [[kserver]] (both contrib and backports). I did this in preparation for adding a ZFS pool with the 3 new 12TB drives I installed today.
- Take a look [here](https://backports.debian.org/Instructions/) for how to add the Backports repo (I created a new .list file in /etc/apt/sources.list.d/)
- Oh, and I installed 3 x 12TB Seagate IronWolf drives in kserver
- You're going to need to read [this](https://wiki.debian.org/ZFS) several times.
