### What is special about today?
- Maybe I shouldn't document this, but I totally stopped my alarm clock this am and ended up waking up like 25 minutes later than I usually leave the house for work.  oops!

### Learning/Working On:
- Moved two computers in the stockroom into a different OU in Active Directory to prevent unwanted web browsing (STOCKROOM-2 and STOCKROOM-4)
- Organized some Obsidian notes a little better.  Learning about Markdown in a better way.
- Started learning about [[Demo Canvas.canvas|Demo Canvas]] feature here.
