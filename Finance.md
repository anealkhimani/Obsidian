# Banking
## [Chase Bank](https://chase.com)
Currently, I have a personal checking account with Chase Bank.  Liz and I share a Joint Checking account there as well.

## [Wells Fargo](https://wellsfargo.com)
Liz banks here.  She holds a personal Checking Account at Wells Fargo


# Credit Cards
## [Capital One](https://capitalone.com)
Aneal makes all his persona purchases using this card.  He earns cash-back on all purchases
Each Thursday (Payday) I pay my balance on this card in full from my [[Finance#[Chase Bank](https //chase.com) | Chase Checking Account]]

## [American Express](https://americanexpress.com)
Annual membership fee is assessed each January in the amount of $150 USD.  This card balance is paid manually each time it is used (which is infrequent). 

## [Citi Double-Cash](https://citi.com)
This card account is enrolled in Auto-Pay from our [[Finance#[Chase Bank](https //chase.com)|Joint Checking Acct.]]
I previously used it to pay my T-Mobile (previously Sprint) cell phone bill, but not sure what it's being used for now (if anything)

## Chase Freedom Unlimited
I'm an authorized user of this card that Liz signed us up for.  There's no account access for authorized users.  All of our joint purchases are made with this card (Bills, dinner out, one-off purchases, home stuff).  Liz manually pays this bill bi-weekly from the [[Finance#[Chase Bank](https //chase.com)|Joint Checking Account]]

## [Lowe's](https://lowes.com)
I signed up for a Lowe's line of credit when I bought my Delta Table Saw.  Doing so saved me 10% off my purchase at the time.  Also, I save 5% each time I use the card.  I pay this card balance in full manually after each use (either with my personal Checking Account or the Joint Account, based on who the purchase was for)



# Crypto Currency
## [Exodus](https://exodus.com)
I'm currently using Exodus as a Software based Crypto Currency Wallet.  It's installed on my home machine and my work machine and phone.

There's a 12 word 'secret phrase' associated with the app used as a recovery tool.  This phrase is printed on paper and held in both the safe at home and the File Cabinet under the `misc` folder.

If you forget the password to the Exodus app (or want to install it on another machine) You'll need to use this 12 word phrase.  It is ***VERY IMPORTANT*** that you do not lose this phrase.  If so, you won't ***EVER*** be able to access those funds again (as of this writing, about $5800 USD)

## [Coinbase](https://coinbase.com)
This is a crypto-currency exchange where I usually purchase/sell crypto currencies.  I've linked my personal checking account here to facilitate ease of these processes.
Purchases are automatically put into a cloud based Coinbase wallet.  I usually transfer these crypto assets to my Exodus wallet as soon as it's feasible (cost effective).

# Stocks
## [E-Trade](https://etrade.com)
I hold a brokerage account here for buying/selling stocks.  It's linked to my personal checking account to facilitate movement of Fiat currency into/out of the account.

## [Robinhood](https://robinhood.com)
I have a Robinhood account.  The app is installed on my personal Cell phone.  There is one share of some random stock in the account that I received for free as a result of signing up for an account.  There's no real value there (as of this writing: `dv: this.file.ctime`, maybe $5 USD?)


# Retirement
## [Principal](https://accounts.principal.com/)
I currently (`dv: this.file.ctime`) hold a Roth-IRA and a traditional 401(k) account here.  


# Other
---
## HSA ([Bend](https://user.bendhsa.com/#/))
Currently (`dv: this.file.ctime`) I contribute $30/pay period towards my Healthcare Savings Account.  The balance there is roughly $7000 USD

On 6/21/2023 I enrolled for an HSA Investment account which allows me to invest my HSA balance into securities.  I have not allocated these funds yet...

# Subscriptions
---
### [[Home Assistant|Nabu Casa]]: 
This subscription allows for Cloud connection to our [[Home Assistant]] instance.  Currently it's $6/monthly, I'm not sure where it's funded from, maybe the Banana stand?
### [Newshosting](https://controlpanel.newshosting.com/customer/index.php)
This subscription allows access to the IRC newsgroups.  I believe it's $15/monthly, and again, I'm not sure where this is funded from.

## [Arlo](https://my.arlo.com)
We have a subscription to [Arlo Secure](https://my.arlo.com/#/settings/subscription/) for our security camera setup.  This subscription comes as a requirement for cloud recording of video and the full use of the 6 cameras we have connected to our setup.  It appears to be $12.00/monthly + tax (which is too high, IMHO)  I have plans for moving to PoE cameras and ZoneMinder (etc) eventually
