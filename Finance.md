# Banking
## [Chase Bank](https://chase.com)
Currently, I have a personal checking account with Chase Bank.  Liz and I share a Joint Checking account there as well.

## [Wells Fargo](https://wellsfargo.com)
Liz banks here.  She holds a personal Checking Account at Wells Fargo


# Credit Cards
## [Capital One](https://capitalone.com)
Aneal makes all his persona purchases using this card.  He earns cash-back on all purchases
Each Thursday (Payday) I pay my balance on this card in full from my [[Finance#[Chase Bank](https //chase.com) | Chase Checking Account]]

## [American Express](https://americanexpress.com)
Annual membership fee is assessed each January in the amount of $150 USD.  This card balance is paid manually each time it is used (which is infrequent). 

## [Citi Double-Cash](https://citi.com)
This card account is enrolled in Auto-Pay from our [[Finance#[Chase Bank](https //chase.com)|Joint Checking Acct.]]
I previously used it to pay my T-Mobile (previously Sprint) cell phone bill, but not sure what it's being used for now (if anything)
