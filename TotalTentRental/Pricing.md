## Delivery Fee
Consider each delivery.  You'll make 2 round trips (deliver and retrieve).
If the client is 25 miles away, you've driven 100 miles for this job.

I'm aiming for $1/mile delivery fee

So for this scenario, I would add on a $100 delivery fee:

Let client's know that if they prefer to pick up the products themselves, they can (as long as they're able to safely transport them to/from their locale in a truck or on a trailer)

Of course, free pickup would only apply to such objects that do not require any setup.  ALL tents will require setup and delivery.
