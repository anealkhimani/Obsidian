## Banking
I opened a [Chase Business Checking](https://chase.com) account to serve my TTR business.  This happened [[2024-06-10]]
It seems that I should be able to utilize this account to accept payments much like Square or some others, at comparable rates.

I need to investigate that

## Payments
I opened a [Square](https://squareup.com) account to handle payments for TTR.  They allow for invoicing/quotes,  attaching contracts/rental agreements and let the users pay online.  The money that users pay should make it to my account automatically after some short period (2 business days?)
