[[2024-05-29]], I started a new 'Droplet' on my server provider [[DigitalOcean]]
The droplet should cost me about $12/month? 

## MongoDB
I created a new Project in [MongoDB Atlas](https://mongodb.com) to persist data for various things related to this business.  In that Project I created a cluster named `website` with user credentials:
```
UN: anealkhimani
PW: B2RpG2ShJfi3N2T2
```
This cluster is accessible from within specific IP addresses only, so for now, it will only allow connections from my work IP address.  You can add more in the UI at MongoDB.com>(project_name)>Network Access

## Domain Name
I purchased [poshpartyrental.com](http://poshpartyrental.com) [[2024-05-22]] from [NameCheap.com](https://namecheap.com)
I plan on building a website for the business using the attached CSS template I found.  It'll require heavy modification to work for me, but I'm not afraid of that.

It appears that the name Posh Party Rentals was taken at the Georgia Secretary of State level.  That said, I switched business name ideas to Liz's recommendation 'Total Tent Rental' and purchased:
- TotalTentRental.com
- TotalTentRentals.com

These were both registered at the same locale as the domain above, [NameCheap.com](https://namecheap.com)
