I purchased [poshpartyrental.com](http://poshpartyrental.com) [[2024-05-22]] from [NameCheap.com](https://namecheap.com)
I plan on building a website for the business using the attached CSS template I found.  It'll require heavy modification to work for me, but I'm not afraid of that.

It appears that the name Posh Party Rentals was taken at the Georgia Secretary of State level.  That said, I switched business name ideas to Liz's recommendation 'Total Tent Rental' and purchased:
- TotalTentRental.com
- TotalTentRentals.com

These were both registered at the same locale as the domain above, [NameCheap.com](https://namecheap.com)
