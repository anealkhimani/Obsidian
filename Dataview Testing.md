### Let's do a dataview!
>[!info]- Check out the code block below:
>```dataview
>LIST
>```
>In this block, we started off by using Dataview Query Language (DQL) to create a code block that retrieves metadata on our notes.  This one opens a code block with triple backticks immediately followed by the word 'dataview'.  Then on the next line, we create our query.  In this case we're only using 'LIST' to have dataview retrieve all filenames of all files (with no 'WHERE' clause in effect).
