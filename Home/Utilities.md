## Georgia Power (Account 14478-41082)
Logging into this website is a challenge, despite having a password manager.
At any rate, this bill is auto-paid from a draft from our [[Chase]] joint checking account


## [AT&T](https://att.com) (Account# 138064828)
Our internet service provider (ISP).  Currently we are enrolled in the AT&T FIBER--INTERNET 1000 plan.  It appears that our monthly bill is $85.32

## [Water](https://myaccount.dekalbcountyga.gov) (Account# 3136155304)
We pay our water and sewage bill through this entity.  It's been a mess in the past.
Currently, we auto-pay this bill by using Chase's bill pay mechanism.  We overpay the bill every month and we're refunded or carry a balance forward to avoid paying their ridiculous online payment fees. (It's freaking [[2024-04-21]], already)

## ~~[Gas South](https://manage.gassouth.com/) (Account# 9455424615)~~
~~Our natural gas provider.  This bill is auto-paid with the [[Chase]] joint checking account~~

## Georgia Natural Gas
As of [[2024-07-10]], I swapped our natural gas provider to this company.  [[Gas South]] wanted us to renew our plan at .69/therm.  GNG had a deal for .59/therm.
