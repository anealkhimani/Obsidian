# Overview
- Home automation platform used to control/monitor devices and other things in the house
- It currently runs on [[k_server]] in a #docker container.
## Nabu Casa
This service is used to enable us to connect to this Docker container running locally on our home network over the internet, without actually exposing it.  We pay a $6 monthly service fee for this service.  While I did initially try to DIY it, the $6 fee goes to support the project, which I'm cool with.
